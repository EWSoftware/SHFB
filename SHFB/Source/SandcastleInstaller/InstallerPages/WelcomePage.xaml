      <Paragraph>Sandcastle, created by Microsoft, is a set of tools used to create documentation from .NET
assemblies and their associated XML comments files.  Depending on the type of help file that you want to produce,
one or more additional tools may be required.  In addition, there are third-party tools and components that you
may find useful.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>This application will guide you through the process needed to create a working
installation so that you can start producing help files with Sandcastle.  Some of the additional tools,
such as the help compilers, are not open source and thus are not included with this guided installation
package.  This application will search for the required tools and give you instructions on how to download
and install them if they are not found.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>This installer comes with the version of the
