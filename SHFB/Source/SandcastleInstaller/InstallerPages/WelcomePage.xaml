      <Paragraph>Sandcastle, created by Microsoft, is a set of tools used to create MSDN-style
documentation from .NET assemblies and their associated XML comments files.  Depending on the type of
help file that you want to produce, one or more additional tools may be required.  In addition, there are
community patches and third-party build tools and components that you may find useful.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>This application will guide you through the process needed to create a working
installation so that you can start producing help files with Sandcastle.  Some of the additional tools,
such as the help compilers, are not open source and thus are not included with this guided installation
package.  This application will search for the required tools and give you instructions on how to download
and install them if they are not found.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>This installer comes with the version of
<Hyperlink NavigateUri="https://GitHub.com/EWSoftware/SHFB">Sandcastle</Hyperlink> displayed in the main title
above.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Third-party build tool and component providers may also use this installer with their
product.  In such cases, their tools and components will be installed after Sandcastle and the related tools
noted above.</Paragraph>
