  <Paragraph>The Microsoft Help 2 compiler could not be found on this system.  If you will be creating
Help 2 files, you will need to follow the instructions below to download and install it using one of the
listed SDKs.  If you will not, you can safely skip this step.  You can run this application again to install
it later if needed.</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>Because the Help 2 compiler is not available separately, it must be installed as part of the
Visual Studio SDK.  This may require that you have the associated version of Microsoft Visual Studio
installed as well.  It is only available in SDKs for Visual Studio 2008 and earlier.</Paragraph>

You only need to install one of the following SDKs to obtain the Help 2 compiler components.</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph Margin="20" Padding="10" Background="#FFFFCC" BorderThickness="1" BorderBrush="Black">
The SDKs for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 both contain an outdated version of Sandcastle.  This can cause
problems after installing Sandcastle as the environment variable that it uses to find its components may
point to the wrong location causing build errors.  If you install one of the SDKs, it is highly recommended
that you reboot before continuing with the Sandcastle tools installation so that the issue can be detected
and fixed.</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>Help 2 files are not used by Visual Studio 2010 or later and their related SDKs do not contain
the Help 2 compiler.</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph><Bold>NOTE:</Bold> You must install version 1.0 of the Visual Studio 2008 SDK.  Version 1.1
does not contain the Help 2 compiler components.</Paragraph>
