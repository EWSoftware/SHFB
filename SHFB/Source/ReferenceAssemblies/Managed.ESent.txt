This is a custom version of Managed ESent specifically for use with the Sandcastle Help File Builder.  It
contains some changes to add local caching of values, support for disabling column compression, an increased
version store size to handle loading of large data sets in parallel, and serialization support is enabled with
changes to allow serialization of reference types.
