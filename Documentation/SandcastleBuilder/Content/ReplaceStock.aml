    <introduction>
      <para>It is possible to replace the stock content files that are included in each help file (style sheets,
scripts, icons, images, etc.).  The stock content is copied from a presentation style sub-folders which can be
found under the <localUri>.\Components</localUri> folder of the root help file builder installation
folder.  Each presentation style has its own folder such as <localUri>.\Default2022</localUri>,
<localUri>.\VS2013</localUri>, etc.</para>
    </introduction>

<section>
  <content>
		<para>The folder structure for the content that gets added to each help file is the typically the same in
each and consists of the following:</para>

		<list class="bullet">
			<listItem>
				<para>The <localUri>icons\</localUri> folder contains stock help file images (i.e. for property icons,
method icons, etc.).</para>
			</listItem>
			<listItem>
				<para>The <localUri>scripts\</localUri> folder contains stock JavaScript files.</para>
			</listItem>
			<listItem>
				<para>The <localUri>styles\</localUri> or <localUri>css\</localUri> folder contains stock style sheets.</para>
			</listItem>
		</list>

		<para>In addition, an <localUri>html\</localUri> folder is created when the help file is built to contain the
help pages generated from the documented assemblies and conceptual content.  You can place additional HTML files
to add to the project in a folder by the same name in your project or you can place them in the root of the
project.  Be sure to use an appropriate relative path on image references or links to other HTML pages based on
the folder in which you place the content.</para>

		<para>Modifying the Sandcastle copy of the presentation files directly will affect all help files that you
build with the help file builder.  For example, if you want to modify the style sheet for all projects you create
with the help file builder, edit the <localUri>branding.css</localUri> files in the <localUri>.\styles</localUri>
folders.  The files do not need to be added to your project in that case.  The downside to this approach is that
you must maintain the changes with each new release of the help file builder.  In such cases, it is better to
<link xlink:href="baf1dcbc-e9cf-4d71-a770-621e6eaf10a7">create your own presentation style</link> based on the
existing one.</para>

		<para>If you want to modify the files on a per project basis, that is when you would copy them to your
project's folder.  By adding the file to the project that resides in a like-named folder and has the same
filename, you can replace the default file of the same name copied by the presentation style. In the example
above, you would do the following assuming you are using the Default2022 presentation style:</para>

		<list class="ordered">
			<listItem>
				<para>Right click on the project name in the Solution Explorer window and select the option to add a new
folder.  Call it <localUri>css</localUri> to match the folder in the presentation style.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>Copy the style sheet files that you want to modify from the presentation file folder to the new
project folder (<localUri>presentationStyle.css</localUri> for example located in the
<localUri>%ProgramFiles(x86)\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\Components\Default2022\css</localUri> folder.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>Modify the style sheet files as needed.  As an example, open the <localUri>presentationStyle.css</localUri>
file in the project and change the <codeInline>codeHeader</codeInline> style's font and add a color entry to make
the text green:</para>

<code language="none" title=" ">
.codeHeader {
		font-family: Arial;
		font-style: normal;
		background-color: #e6e6e6;
		box-sizing: content-box;
		color: green;
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: row;
		margin-top: 1em;
		padding-right: 0.25em
}
</code>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>Save the changes, build the help project, and then open the resulting help file.  Note that the
code section headers are now using the new style.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>Most of the styles are contained in the <localUri>branding.css</localUri> file.  The other files
are format-specific overrides that change the styles slightly in the help format indicated by the filename
suffix so that the topics look fairly consistent across all help formats.  You can view the HTML for the
rendered topics to determine the elements and/or class names that may need modifying in the style sheet.</para>
			</listItem>

		</list>

		<alert class="note">
			<para>The presentation styles are all different and their files are not interchangeable.  As such, if you
change the presentation style, you must copy the matching files from the new presentation style and modify them
with your changes.</para>
