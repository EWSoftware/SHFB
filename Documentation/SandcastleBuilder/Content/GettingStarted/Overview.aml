			<para>The Sandcastle Help File Builder standalone GUI provides an environment in which you can edit the
properties that control the features and appearance of the compiled help file.  In addition, it lets you manage
various files associated with the help project.  A Visual Studio package is also available.  For a comparison
of features and where to find them, see the <link xlink:href="b128ad2a-787e-48c7-b946-f6953080c386" /> topics.</para>

				<para>Shown above is the help file builder's main form.  The menu bar at the top provides access to the
various program options:
				</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>The <ui>File</ui> menu provides access to the various project and file related commands such as
creating a new project, saving the project, and interacting with the Project Explorer window to manage the files
in the project.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The <ui>Documentation</ui> menu contains the commands used to build the help file, view the log
file from a build, and view the compiled help in its various formats.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The <ui>Window</ui> menu contains the commands used to show the various task windows and jump
to any of the open topic or file editors.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The <ui>Help</ui> menu allows you to open the help file, view the
<link xlink:href="1aea789d-b226-4b39-b534-4c97c256fac8" /> help topic, and view product version and copyright
information.</para>
					</listItem>

				</list>

				<para>Many of these options are also available within the individual tabbed windows and docked panes via
keyboard shortcuts, context menus, and toolbar buttons.  The toolbar just below the menu bar contains buttons for
most of the common options.  The images on each button correspond to the images on the matching menu option in
the menu bar dropdown menus.  In addition, it contains two dropdowns: one for the Configuration option and one
for the Platform option.  These values are used to specify the default configuration and platform values to use
when extracting information from Visual Studio project documentation sources when they do not specify a value for
themselves in their properties.</para>

				<para>The central area of the main form is where you will see the various file editors and task windows.
The windows can be dragged around and docked in various locations.  Shown above are the two main windows that you
will use most often: the <link xlink:href="e12c2b9f-18c7-4718-850b-ac3c2e293672" /> and the
<link xlink:href="e32086c6-de17-4e54-a746-1ac80bf0c45a" />.  If you are at all familiar with Visual Studio or
third-party integrated development environments like SharpDevelop, these windows should look and feel quite
similar in appearance and usage.</para>
