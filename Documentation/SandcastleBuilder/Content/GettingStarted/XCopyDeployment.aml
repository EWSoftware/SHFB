		<introduction>
			<para>For use in a build server environment, the Sandcastle Help File Builder and Tools support simple
XCOPY deployment.  As long as the <environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable> system environment variable
points to the location of the help file builder assemblies, it will be able to find everything it needs at build
time.  In such situations, custom build components, plug-ins, syntax generators, and presentation styles may also
be copied to the help file builder folder or a sub-folder beneath it.</para>

			<para>A NuGet Package is also available (<application>EWSoftware.SHFB</application>) that allows you to
deploy the Sandcastle Help File Builder tools inside of a project to build help files without installing the
tools manually and without defining the <environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable> environment variable.
Certain limitations apply in this case and are detailed in the package's Read Me file which is displayed when the
package is installed.</para>

				<para>When searching for custom components, the following search order is used:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>If a <codeInline>ComponentPath</codeInline> project property value is set, the folder it refers
to is searched first and then the actual project folder is searched.  If the property contains no value, the
actual project folder is searched first.</para>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>
						<para>Next, the common application data folders noted in the
<link xlink:href="a24489fb-45d6-46f4-9eaa-9a9c4e0919b2" /> topic are searched.</para>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>
						<para>Finally, the help file builder installation folder (<environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable>)
is searched.</para>
					</listItem>
				</list>

				<para>If any duplicate components are encountered, the first one loaded based on the above search order
will be used.</para>

				<para>If your version of Visual Studio supports them, <codeInline>PackageReference</codeInline> elements
can be used to add the help file builder packages to your project.  The packages contain a properties file that
defines the necessary project properties to define the root path and component path so that you do not have to
define them manually as described below.</para>

<code language="xml" title=" ">
&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="EWSoftware.SHFB" Version="2019.6.24" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="EWSoftware.SHFB.NETFramework" Version="4.7.2" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code>
				
				<para>If not using package references, it is possible to build a project without defining the
<codeInline>SHFBROOT</codeInline> environment variable such as when using the NuGet package.  To do this, a
conditional <codeInline>SHFBROOT</codeInline> property must be added to each help file builder project as a child
of the main <codeInline>PropertyGroup</codeInline> element.  An example is shown below (lines wrapped for display
purposes):</para>

<code language="xml" title=" ">
&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
	&lt;!-- NOTE: Update the version number in the path (YYYY.M.D.R) to match the package version --&gt;
	&lt;SHFBROOT Condition=" '$(SHFBROOT)' == '' "&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\packages\
EWSoftware.SHFB.YYYY.M.D.R\Tools\&lt;/SHFBROOT&gt;

	... other SHFB project properties ...

&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code>

				<para>By making it conditional, you can work with the project on your local machine with the available
tools where the environment variable is defined but still allow it to be built on a server using the XCOPY/NuGet
deployment.</para>

				<alert class="important">
					<para>The Help 1 file format is unsupported in the XCOPY/NuGet deployment scenario as it requires
additional tools and components to be installed.  If these tools and components are missing on the build server,
the help file build will fail.  Only the MS Help Viewer, Open XML, website, and markdown help file formats are
guaranteed to work as they have no external tool dependencies.</para>

					<para>For NuGet installations, you must also install one or more of the Reflection Data Set packages
based on which platform types you need: .NETCore, .NETFramework, .NETMicroFramework, .NETPortable, Silverlight,
WindowsPhone, and/or WindowsPhoneApp.  If multiple versions are available for any given reflection data set
package, download the latest version as it will cover all prior versions as well.  For example, the
.NETFramework 4.8 package covers all .NET Framework versions from 1.0 to 4.8.</para>
