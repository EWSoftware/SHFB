Markdown is a plain text format used to write structured documents. The help file builder supports
[CommonMark compliant Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) and uses the [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig)
processor to handle topic conversion.  The following Markdig extensions are enabled and available for use in
topics:

- YAML Header - This is used to specify topic metadata such as the title and keywords.  See below for more information.
- [Abbreviations](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/AbbreviationSpecs.md)
- [Alert Blocks](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/AlertBlockSpecs.md) - The
  help file builder provides some additional features.  See below for more information.
- [Auto-Identifiers](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/AutoIdentifierSpecs.md)
- [Auto-Links](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/AutoLinks.md)
- [Citations](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/FigureFooterAndCiteSpecs.md)
- [Custom Containers](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/CustomContainerSpecs.md)
- [Definition Lists](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/DefinitionListSpecs.md)

- [Figures](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/FigureFooterAndCiteSpecs.md) - The
  help file builder provides some additional features.  See below for more information.
- [Footers](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/FigureFooterAndCiteSpecs.md)
- [Footnotes](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/FootnotesSpecs.md)
- [Generic Attributes](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/GenericAttributesSpecs.md) - This
  is used to add generic attributes to any element.  See below for more information on common usage.
- [Grid Tables](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/GridTableSpecs.md)
- [List Extras](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/ListExtraSpecs.md)
- [Media Links](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/MediaSpecs.md) - Note that
  this is not the same thing as a MAML media link element.  This is used specifically to embed links to videos.
- [Pipe Tables](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/PipeTableSpecs.md)
- Referral Links - This is used to add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to all anchor links in Markdown topics to
  match the behavior of the anchor links generated by the presentation styles.
- [Task Lists](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/TaskListSpecs.md)

Note that when used with the help file builder, Markdown topics support the use of HTML as well as MAML
elements.  As such, if the Markdown syntax does not meet your needs for more complex content, you can fall back
to the equivalent HTML or MAML elements to generate the same output.  The help file builder also supports
rendering Markdown content nested within MAML or HTML elements.  This allows you to use the more structured
elements for such things as tables while still using Markdown for the content. See the section below for more
information on how to make this work.

> [!TIP]
> The [](@e49eea91-a9ef-4aa5-ad8f-16ebd61b798a) can be used to easily find and insert token, image, topic,
> and code entity reference links in the proper format.

## YAML Header
Also referred to as YAML Front Matter, this header is used to specify topic metadata such as the title and
keywords.  The header must appear at the very beginning of the file and be enclosed within triple dashes.  For
example:

``` yaml {title=" "}
---
uid: UniqueTopicID
title: The Topic Title
tocTitle: Optional Title for the Table of Contents
linkText: Optional Text to Use For Links
keywords: keyword, term 1, term 2, "term, with comma"
alt-uid: OptionalAlternateID
summary: Optional summary abstract
# Lines prefixed with a pound sign are considered comments and are ignored.
---
The topic content appears after the YAML header.

```

If the YAML header is omitted or any of the properties are missing, the help file builder will assume default
values based on the property as indicated below.

`uid`
:   The unique identifier for the topic.  If omitted, the unique ID will be generate based on the title, TOC
    title, or link text, or in the absence of those, the topic filename.  It is recommended that you always
    specify a unique ID for each topic to ensure that it remains constant even if the title or filename changes.

`title`
:   The topic title.  If omitted, the title will be derived from the TOC title, link text, or in the absence
    of those, the first section header title if there is one or the filename if not.

`tocTitle`
:   An optional title to use in the table of contents.  If omitted, the TOC title will be derived from the title.
    In some cases, the title may not be appropriate for the table of contents or is too long to be practical.  In
    such cases you can specify shorter or more appropriate text for the table of contents via this property.

`linkText`
:   An optional title to use for links to the topic.  If omitted, the link text will be derived from the title.
    In some cases the title may not be appropriate or may be too long to be practical for links that refer to the
    topic.  In such cases you can specify shorter or more appropriate text for the link via this property.  This
    saves you from having to specify the shorter inner text on each link that uses the topic ID.

`keywords`
:   Optional keywords for the topic.  Multiple keywords should be separated by commas.  Keywords that
    contain commas should be enclosed in double quotes.  This property only has use for the Help 1 (CHM) and
    MS Help Viewer (MSHC) output formats.  They are ignored for website and Open XML presentation styles.

`alt-uid`
:   This can be used to specify an alternate ID for the topic.  This is useful when you want to change the topic
    ID but still want existing links in other topics that use the old ID to continue to work.  It is mainly used
    when converting MAML topics to Markdown and you enable the option to switch to using the filenames for the
    unique IDs.

`summary`
:   This is equivalent to the MAML `summary` element when the `abstract="true"` attribute is used.  The summary
    is added as a `Description` metadata element to the HTML header section.

## In-Page and Topic Links
IDs are automatically generated for section titles in Markdown topics using the Auto-Identifiers extension.
Other in-page link targets can be created by using the attribute syntax to add an ID to a block of text or an
element.

``` none {title=" "}
{id="intro"}
The attribute above adds a link ID to a block of text such as the introduction paragraph.

Term 8 {id="Term8"}
:   Definition 8.  The entry's term has an `id` attribute that can be used as a link target.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td id="Table1Cell1">The cell has an `id` attribute that can be used as a link target</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

To create links to other topics within the documentation, use the standard Markdown link syntax with the topic ID
as the link target prefixed with an `@` character to indicate that it is a topic ID rather than a URL.  The
unique ID or alternate ID can be used as the link target.  If no link text is specified, the topic title will be
used.  To link to a specific section, append a `#` followed by the section ID to the target.  For in-page links,
just specify the pound sign followed by the section ID.  Some examples are shown below.

``` none {title=" "}
Standard link using the topic title as the link text: [](@RelatedTopic)
With inner text: [alternate text for the link](@RelatedTopic)
In-page link to introduction: [Back to Intro](#intro)
Link to a section in another topic: [](@OtherResources#Tools)
```

## Image Links
To display images in Markdown topics, use the standard Markdown image syntax with an image ID
(`![Alt text](@ImageId)`).  The image ID is prefixed with an `@` character to indicate that it is an image ID
rather than a URL.  The image ID should correspond to a file in the project with its Build Action set to `Image`
that has a matching ID.  This is equivalent to the MAML `mediaLinkInline` element.  If no alternate text is
specified, the alternate text from the project file properties will be used if any is specified there.

The Markdig Figure extension can be used to display block images similar to the MAML `mediaLink` element.  The
help file builder adds support for placement and a figure caption to match the MAML element.  To specify the
placement, use the `{placement="value"}` attribute on the opening `^^^` marker where `value` is `near` (left
aligned), `center` (centered alignment), or `far` (right aligned).  A caption can be specified by adding text
after the opening or closing `^^^` marker.  If used on the opening marker, add the text before the placement
attribute if it is specified as well.  For example:

``` none {title=" "}
<!-- No caption, default near (left-aligned) image placement -->
^^^
![](@ImageId)
^^^

<!-- Caption before, centered image -->
^^^ Caption Before {placement="center"}
![](@ImageId)
^^^

<!-- Caption after, far (right-aligned) image alignment -->
^^^ {placement="far"}
![](@ImageId)
^^^ Figure 1: Caption after with lead-in
```

## Code Entity References
To link to code entity topics such as types or API members in Markdown topics, use standard Markdown link syntax
with the API member ID as the link target prefixed with an `@` character to indicate that it is a code entity
rather than a URL.  The following attributes can be used to modify the link behavior:

`show-container="true"`
:   By default namespaces and type names are omitted from the link text for code entities.  By adding this
    attribute, you can include the container name in the link text.  For types, this adds the namespace.
    For API members, it adds the type name.  If inner text is specified for the link, this option will be
    ignored.

`show-parameters="true"`
:   By default, methods omit the parameters in the link text.  By adding this attribute, you can include the
    parameters in the link text.  If inner text is specified for the link or the link is to an overload topic,
    this option will be ignored.

`prefer-overload="true"`
:   Adding this attribute to method code entity references will cause the link to go to the overloads topic for
    the method if there are multiple versions of the method.  If omitted or if there are no overloads, the link
    will go to the indicated member topic instead.

The [](@e49eea91-a9ef-4aa5-ad8f-16ebd61b798a) can be used to easily find and insert code entity reference links
in the proper format.  Some examples are shown below:

``` none {title=" "}
[](@T:System.IO.FileStream){show-container="true"}
[](@M:System.IO.FileStream.#ctor(System.String,System.IO.FileMode)){show-container="true" prefer-overload="true"}
[](@M:System.IO.FileStream.Write(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)){show-container="true" show-parameters="true"}
[](@P:System.IO.FileStream.Length)
[](@M:System.IO.FileStream.Flush){prefer-overload="true"}
[FileStream.Flush on Microsoft Docs](@M:System.IO.FileStream.Flush)
```

## Alert Block Extension
Markdown alert blocks can be used to create alerts similar to the MAML
[alert](https://ewsoftware.github.io/MAMLGuide/html/a8792cd2-e8a1-4e37-bd16-eea84ac463b1.htm) element or the XML
comments [note](https://ewsoftware.github.io/XMLCommentsGuide/html/4302a60f-e4f4-4b8d-a451-5f453c4ebd46.htm)
element.  The help file builder supports using any of the `alert` or `note` class types as the alert block type.
The block type is case-insensitive.  In addition, a custom title can be specified for the alert block by adding
it after the block type separated by a comma.  Some example are shown below:

``` none {title=" "}
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note

> [!caution]
> The block type value is case-insensitive.

> [!SECURITY]
> Do not tape your password to the underside of your keyboard.

> [!CS]
> This could contain C#-specific usage notes.

> [!TODO]
> This could contain a To Do list.

> [!TODO, Project Road Map]
> This alert contains a custom title.
```

## Code Blocks
The help file builder supports all of the same extension attributes on fenced code blocks as it does in MAML
topics when using the `code` element.  Use the attribute syntax after the opening fence to specify the
attributes.  Note that the `language` attribute is not used.  Instead, the language appears immediately after the
back ticks for the fenced code block.  If code blocks are nested within a fenced code block to import code, use
the MAML `code` element to import the nested regions.  An example is show below.  See the
[](@7f03ba39-09f8-4320-bdbd-ed31a3bd885f) topic for more information on the available attributes and their usage.

`````` none {title=" "}
``` csharp {title="Example Code"}

... example code ...

```

``` csharp {title="Imported code block" source="..\Example.cs" region="ExampleRegion"}
```

``` vb {title="Nested code imports"}
<code source="..\Class1.vb" region="Snippet #1" />

' ... Some stuff happens here ...

<code source="..\Class1.vb" region="Snippet #2" />
```
``````

## Language Keywords
To match the behavior of the MAML `languageKeyword` element, prefix the keyword with a colon and enclose it in
back ticks.  Recognized language keywords will then change based on the language filter.

``` none {title=" "}
To match the behavior of the `languageKeyword` MAML element, use this format for
language keywords: `:null`, `:Nothing`, `:Shared`, `:async/await`
```

## No Bullet List Style
Markdown does not have a "no bullet" list style like MAML.  However, by applying the style using the attribute
syntax, you can get the same effect.  A blank line should precede the attribute to ensure that it is applied
correctly to the following list items.  For example:

``` none {title=" "}
- Bullet item

  {class="noBullet"}
  - No bullet item 1
  - No bullet item 2
  - No bullet item 3
- Bullet item 2
```

## Extended Block Element Parsing
Normal Markdown files do not render Markdown nested within HTML elements.  However, the help file builder takes
steps to allow this to happen.  Markdown nested within MAML or HTML elements that appears in Markdown files will
typically be rendered.  However, it may be necessary to insert an extra blank line before and after the Markdown
content in the element that contains it so that it is handled correctly.  The end tag should also be flush left
with no leading spaces.  For example:

``` none {title=" "}
Content *before* the table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
    <th>Header 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="Table1Cell1">

Put a **leading blank line** after the opening tag, no spaces.

Another **paragraph**.  Put a blank line before the closing tag and make sure
it is flush left.

</td>
    <td>

Cell _2_

Para _2_

</td>
    <td>Cell 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Content *after* the table.
```
