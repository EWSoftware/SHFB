				<para>Available plug-ins are listed on the left.  Version, copyright, and description information is
shown below the list and will change to reflect the currently selected plug-in.  The list on the right displays
the plug-ins selected for use in the current project.  Double-click a plug-in on the left or click the <ui>Add</ui>
button to add a plug-in to the project. Click the <ui>Configure</ui> button to configure the plug-in.  Click the
<ui>Delete</ui> button to delete a plug-in from the project.  The checkboxes next to each project plug-in allow
you to enable or disable the plug-in within the project.  If disabled, it will remain in the project with its
configuration information but it will not be used during a build.  Most plug-ins contain a default configuration
but it is most likely not suitable for your project.  As such, you should configure each plug-in that you add to
the project so that it will work as expected.  </para>

				<para>Third-party plug-ins can also be made available on this property page by copying their assembly
and any supporting files to the <localUri>.\Components and Plug-Ins</localUri> folder or a subfolder beneath it
in the help file builder's <legacyBold>Common Application Data</legacyBold> folder.  See the
<link xlink:href="a24489fb-45d6-46f4-9eaa-9a9c4e0919b2#PlugIns" /> topic for more information.  Refer to the
plug-in's documentation for information about its features and configuration options.  For a list of current
third-party plug-ins, see the <link xlink:href="c18d6cb6-e4e4-4944-84ee-f867aa6cfb0d#ThirdParty" /> topic.
