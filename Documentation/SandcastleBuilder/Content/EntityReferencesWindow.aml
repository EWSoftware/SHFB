    <introduction>
      <para>The <ui>Entity References</ui> window allows you to insert MAML elements into conceptual
content topics that represent tokens, images, code entities (API members), code snippets, and links to
other conceptual topics.  To open it in the standalone GUI, select the <ui>Entity References</ui> option on the
<ui>Window</ui> menu, click the related main toolbar button, or hit <ui>F3</ui>.  In the Visual Studio extension,
it can be opened by selecting the <ui>Entity References Window</ui> option from the <ui>View</ui> | <ui>Other
Windows</ui> menu or from the <ui>Other Windows</ui> toolbar button dropdown.</para>

	<para>The dropdown in the toolbar allows you to select which type of reference to insert.  The first
toolbar button, <ui>Refresh</ui>, allows you to refresh the selected references if you make changes to the
project such as adding a new image or token file.  The refresh option will take into account unsaved changes
made to open token, content layout, and site map files in the environment so that current information is
always available without having to save your changes frequently.  The second toolbar button, <ui>Copy</ui>,
will copy the currently selected entity to the clipboard in the selected format ready for pasting into a
topic file.  The <ui>Help</ui> button at the end of the toolbar will bring up this help topic.</para>

	<para>The <ui>Find</ui> textbox allows you to search for an item by ID or display text.  Tokens, images,
code snippets, and table of contents types perform a case-insensitive search for the entered text anywhere
within the entity's ID or display title value.  All items except the table of contents entities show their
ID in the entity references tool window.  Table of contents items show their display title but the search
will look at their ID for a match too.  For code entities, a regular expression search is performed using
the entered text to match all member IDs found in the project's XML comments files and the .NET Framework
comments files.  Hit Enter or click the <ui>Go</ui> button to start the search.  Hit Enter or click
<ui>Go</ui> again to find subsequent matches.</para>

	<para>To insert a reference from the list into a topic, either drag and drop it into the topic or use the
<ui>Copy</ui> option (Ctrl+C) to copy it to the clipboard and then paste it into the topic.  The references
that can be inserted are as follows:</para>

<definitionTable>
  <definedTerm>Tokens</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>When this is selected, a list of all tokens grouped by their containing token file is shown.
In order to be listed, the file must have a <codeInline>BuildAction</codeInline> of <codeInline>Tokens</codeInline>.
When inserted into a topic, the selected ID is wrapped in a MAML <codeInline>token</codeInline> element.</para>
	</definition>

  <definedTerm>Images</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>When this is selected, a list of all conceptual content image files is shown.  To appear, the
file must have a <codeInline>BuildAction</codeInline> of <codeInline>Image</codeInline>.  This entity type
offers a choice of formats.  For MAML conceptual topics, choose either <ui>MAML media link</ui>,
<ui>MAML inline medial link</ui>, or <ui>MAML external link</ui> depending on the type of link that you
want to create.  For HTML topics, choose the <ui>HTML image link</ui> option.  The HTML option is for
backward compatibility with the older additional content model and should not be used for MAML conceptual
content topics.</para>
	</definition>

	<definedTerm>Table of Contents</definedTerm>
	<definition>
		<para>When this is selected, all content layout and site map files are merged in the order defined in
their project settings to produce a table of content list that can be used for inserting links to the
topics.  For their topics to appear, content layout files must have a <codeInline>BuildAction</codeInline>
of <codeInline>ContentLayout</codeInline> and site map files must have a <codeInline>BuildAction</codeInline>
of <codeInline>SiteMap</codeInline>.  The expanded/collapsed and the last selected topic state is stored
within each file.  As such, the topics will appear in the entity references window in the state you last
used them and the last selected topic in the file will be selected as the default item in the tool window.
This is helpful when you have the associated content layout file open for editing in the environment.</para>

		<para>For MAML conceptual topics, choose <ui>MAML link</ui> as the type to create.  To insert MAML topic
references in XML comments in your source code, choose <ui>XML comments conceptualLink</ui> as the type to
create.  For HTML topics, choose the <ui>HTML anchor link</ui> option.  The HTML option is for backward
compatibility with the older additional content model and should not be used for MAML conceptual content
topics.  It is not recommended for XML comments either as the link target format may vary based on the help file
format.</para>
	</definition>

  <definedTerm>Code Snippets</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>When this is selected, a list of all code snippets grouped by their containing code snippet file
is shown.  In order to be listed, the file must have a <codeInline>BuildAction</codeInline> of
<codeInline>CodeSnippets</codeInline>.  When inserted into a topic, the selected ID is wrapped in a MAML
<codeInline>codeReference</codeInline> element.</para>
	</definition>

  <definedTerm>Code Entities</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>When this option is selected for the first time, there is a short delay while all XML comments
files plus the .NET Framework comments files are indexed to obtain a list of possible API members that can
be used as code entity references.  Due to the large number of elements, they are not listed.  Instead,
enter some text or a regular expression in the <ui>Find</ui> textbox and hit Enter or the <ui>Go</ui> button
to list all members that match the search text.  The match count is limited to the first 1000 entries found
to prevent exceedingly long lists of results.</para>

	<para>The <ui>MAML code entity reference</ui> format option allows you to insert references to the
selected element in MAML conceptual topic files as <codeInline>codeEntityReference</codeInline> elements.
When the help file is built, these will be resolved to links that will take you to the help page for that
item (i.e. the API member help page for your classes or online help pages for .NET Framework members).
The <ui>XML comments see link</ui> option is for backward compatibility with the older additional content
model and should not be used for MAML conceptual content topics.  Note that these older style links will
only be resolved to a clickable link if the item references a member found in your code.  It will not
create links to .NET Framework members in HTML files.</para>
