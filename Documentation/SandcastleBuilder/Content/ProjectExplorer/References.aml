		<introduction>
			<para>The <application>MRefBuilder</application> tool may not resolve references to all assemblies used by
a target, especially those found in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).  As such, it needs a hint to find the files
and load them when needed.  The <ui>References</ui> project node is used to specify a list of dependencies used
by the <application>MRefBuilder</application> tool when it generates reflection information for the documentation
source assemblies.  Dependency information allows inherited members to be listed for a type but topics will not
be generated for them and the information will not appear in the table of contents of the help file.</para>

			<title>Adding a Reference</title>
			<content>
				<para>To add a reference, right click on the <ui>References</ui> project node and select
<ui>Add File/Project Reference...</ui> or <ui>Add GAC Reference...</ui>.  These options can also be selected from
the <ui>File | Project Explorer | References</ui> menu.  Files can also be dragged and dropped on the node from
Windows Explorer.  The following reference types are supported in the project.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para><legacyBold>File Reference</legacyBold> - Select an assembly to use as the reference.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><legacyBold>Project Reference</legacyBold> - Select a Visual Studio project to use as a
reference.  In this case, the output assembly of the project is used as the reference unless the
<codeInline>ReferenceOutputAssembly</codeInline> property is set to false (see below).</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><legacyBold>GAC Reference</legacyBold> - Select an entry from the Global Assembly Cache to use
as the reference.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><legacyBold>COM Reference</legacyBold> - COM references are also supported.  However, they
can only be added in Visual Studio.  They cannot be added via the standalone GUI.  As an alternative, you can add
the COM-callable wrappers that Visual Studio creates as file references.</para>

					<para>If you have one or more folders containing reference assemblies that you would like to scan and
include at build time, you can use the <link xlink:href="96557037-c19e-4183-bcf1-f42d7018de9f" /></para>

			<title>Editing a Reference</title>
			<content>
				<para>When selected, file and project references allow you to edit the <codeInline>HintPath</codeInline>
property to specify the referenced file.  All other references have read-only properties.  To change them, remove
them and add the desired references in their place.  Project references also contain a
<codeInline>ReferenceOutputAssembly</codeInline> property.  If set to true (the default), the project's output
assembly will be used as a reference.  If set to false, the reference will be ignored.  This is useful for
defining project dependencies that MSBuild can use to determine the build order of projects within a solution
without including the project's assembly as an actual reference.</para>

				<alert class="note">
					<para>If using environment variables in the hint path, use the MSBuild format rather than percent signs
so that they are expanded correctly (i.e. <codeInline>$(MyVar)\Reference.dll</codeInline>).</para>

selected from the <ui>File | Project Explorer | References</ui> menu.</para>
