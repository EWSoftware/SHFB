		<introduction>
			<para>The Visual Studio text editor is feature rich and very little needed to be added in the way of extra
features to support the Sandcastle Help File Builder.  The following sections describe the built-in features that
you can take advantage of as well as a couple of extra additions added by the help file builder's integration
package.</para>

			<title>IntelliSense for the MAML Schemas</title>
			<content>
				<para>When editing MAML topics, you can take advantage of IntelliSense to help you enter the MAML
elements, their attributes, and attribute values.  The MAML schemas are installed in the Visual Studio schema
cache by the package.  In addition, hovering the mouse over a link or image target ID will show you information
about the target file (title, filename, etc.).  This is useful as most items are identified by a GUID and the
quick info tooltip can provide a better idea of what the link will go to.  If you Ctrl+Click on the link target,
the item will be opened in the related text or image editor.  This feature (Go to Definition) is available in
both MAML topic files as well as XML comments elements in source code.  Note that the Go to Definition feature
must be enabled in the help file builder options in order to work.</para>

			<title>Drag and Drop</title>
			<content>
				<para>The text editor window also supports drag and drop operations from the <ui>Content Layout Editor</ui>
and the <ui>Site Map Editor</ui>  to insert links to other topics in the project.  It also supports drag and
drop from the <ui>Entity References Window</ui> to insert token references, image links, code entity reference
inks, code snippet references, and table of contents links.</para>

				<para>By default, links to MAML topics are inserted as self-closing link elements and will use the topic's
title from the content layout file when converted to HTML at build-time.  If necessary, you can modify the link
element to specify inner text which will be used instead of the title text.</para>

		<section address="HTMLEncoding">
			<title>HTML Encoding Selected Text</title>
			<content>
				<para>When editing MAML topics and other XML files, you will see an extra option on the text editor's
context menu: <ui>HTML Encode Selected Text</ui>.  It is only enabled when there is selected text.  If selected
from the context menu, it will HTML encode the selected text.  This is useful for the content of
<codeInline>code</codeInline> elements.  You can paste text into the element and then use this option to encode
it rather than editing the text by hand to encode the special characters.</para>

		<section address="Snippets">
			<title>MAML Snippets</title>
			<content>
				<para>When editing MAML topics, you can take advantage of snippets to insert various block and inline
MAML elements.  This is useful if you are not yet familiar with the various common MAML elements or for quickly
inserting block elements that have several parts like the <codeInline>externalLink</codeInline> element.  In
order to do this, use the option in the guided installer to install the MAML snippets in the Visual Studio
snippet cache.  If you did not do it when you first installed the tools, you can re-run the guided installer and
skip down to the step that installs them.</para>

				<para>To take advantage of the MAML snippets, use one of the following snippet insertion commands:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Select <ui>Insert Snippet</ui> from the text editor context menu or press its shortcut key
combination <ui>Ctrl+K, Ctrl+X</ui>.  This will allow you to insert a snippet at the selected location.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Certain elements support wrapping selected text within the snippet (i.e. the various
inline elements).  To wrap the selected text in the snippet element, select <ui>Surround With</ui> from the text
editor context menu or press its shortcut key combination <ui>Ctrl+K, Ctrl+S</ui>.</para>
					</listItem>

				</list>

				<para>Regardless of the option chosen, an auto-completion pop-up will appear.  Select the <ui>My
Xml Snippets</ui> option using either the down arrow key or by typing its name and pressing Enter or by
double-clicking it with the mouse.  Repeat the process to select either the <ui>MAML Block Elements</ui> or
<ui>MAML Inline Elements</ui> category.  The list of elements will then appear.  If you selected <ui>Insert
Snippet</ui>, you will see the full list of available snippets in the selected category.  If you selected
<ui>Surround With</ui>, the available elements are limited to those that can surround the selected text.
Select the one you want by  using the down arrow key or typing its name and pressing Enter or double-clicking
it with the mouse.</para>

				<para>Certain snippets such as <codeInline>externalLink</codeInline> have replacement parameters.  In
such cases, you will be placed on the first parameter and can type over its default value.  Press the Tab key to
move between any subsequent parameters.  Hovering the mouse over a parameter location will give you a tool tip
describing the parameter.  Press Enter when done to complete the process.</para>

				<para>Refer to the Visual Studio documentation for information on adding your own custom snippets.</para>
