Welcome to the Sandcastle Help File Builder.  This project is composed of two separate parts that work together:
the Sandcastle tools and the Sandcastle Help File Builder. The Sandcastle tools are used to create help files for
managed class libraries containing both conceptual and API reference topics. API reference topics are created by
combining the XML comments that are embedded in your source code with the syntax and structure of the types which
is acquired by reflecting against the associated .NET Framework assembly.  Conceptual topics are created by
converting Markdown files or XML documents containing Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML) that you
author.  The Sandcastle tools are command-line based and have no GUI front-end, project management features, or
an automated build process.

The Sandcastle Help File Builder was created to fill in the gaps, provide the missing NDoc-like features that are
used most often, and provide standalone GUI and command line based tools to build a help file in an automated
fashion. A Visual Studio integration package is also available for it so that help projects can be created and
managed entirely from within Visual Studio.

Sandcastle was originally created by Microsoft back in 2006. The last official release from Microsoft occurred in
June 2010.  Until October 2012, it was hosted at the Sandcastle project site on CodePlex.  In October 2012,
Microsoft officially declared that they were ceasing support and development of Sandcastle. The Sandcastle tools
have been merged into the <token>SHFB</token> project and all future development and support for them will be
handled at its project site.
