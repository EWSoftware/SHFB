Release notes for version 2022.4.16.0.



## Changes in This Release

- Made various general revisions to reflect how the XML comments elements are currently used.
- Added a topic for the [](@4C57ED2C-F373-4B34-B983-A0009D6CDAB4) elements.
- Updated the [](@4302a60f-e4f4-4b8d-a451-5f453c4ebd46) element topic with
information on a new `todo` note type and a new optional `title`
attribute that can be used to override the default note title.
- Updated the `threadsafety` topic to note that inner text can be used to
specify a custom thread safety message.
- Added a note to the Code Contracts topic to indicate that the elements are no longer supported
directly by the help file builder presentation styles as the code contracts project has been abandoned.
