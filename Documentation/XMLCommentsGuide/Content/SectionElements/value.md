This element is used to provide a more detailed description of a property value.



## Syntax

This top-level element is valid on all properties.  Use it when necessary to provide more detailed
information about a property's value such as how it is used, valid values, etc.


``` xml{title=" "}
<value>description</value>
```


## Remarks

The value description will only appear in the help file and can be as long as necessary.  It is
similar in nature to the `remarks` element but is specific to property members.



## Examples

``` cs{title=" " source="SampleClass.cs" region="value Example"}
```
