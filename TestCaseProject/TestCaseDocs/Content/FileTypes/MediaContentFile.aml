    <introduction>
      <para>The media (images) used by conceptual content in a help file project
are defined in a separate media content file.  Each is assigned a unique ID
that is used to refer to the image in conceptual topic links.  When a help file
is built, all images referenced by an image link are copied to the help file's
<localUri>.\Media</localUri> folder.  Any unused images are omitted.</para>
      <alert class="note">
        <para>The <token>SHFB</token> does not use a media content file
directly.  Instead, images are managed as project file items and the media
content file is created for you automatically at build time based on the
property values on those items.</para>

      <title>Media Content File Format</title>
      <content>
        <para>Below is an example of a media content file.</para>
        <code language="xml" title="Example Media Content File" source="ExampleFiles\MediaContent.xml" />
        <para>The file consists of a root <codeInline>stockSharedContentDefinitions</codeInline>
node that contains one or more <codeInline>item</codeInline> nodes that
represent the images.</para>
        <para>The <codeInline>item</codeInline> element has an
<codeInline>id</codeInline> attribute that gives each one a unique identifier.
This is used as the target of the media link elements in the topics.  Within
the item element is a required <codeInline>image</codeInline> element used to
define the image.  The <codeInline>file</codeInline> attribute should point to
the location of the image file.  A relative or absolute path can be used as long
as it can be located at build time.  If you would like to display alternate
text when the mouse hovers over the image, nest an <codeInline>altText</codeInline>
element within the image element as shown in the first item in the example
above.  The inner text for it defines the alternate text to display.</para>
        <alert class="note">
          <para>The unique ID is not case-sensitive.  The example above uses GUID
values for the ID but you are free to use any unique value that you like.</para>
        </alert>
        <alert class="warning">
          <para>Unlike topics, image files will retain their name when copied
to the media folder.  As such, if you add two images from different locations
that have the same name, one will overwrite the other when the help file is
built.</para>
