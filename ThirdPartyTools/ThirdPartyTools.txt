This folder contains third-party tools that may be used with the help file builder.

HTMLHelp.exe
Microsoft HTML Help Workshop installer.  Use this if you need to install the HTML help workshop tool to build
Help 1 (CHM files).  The official Microsoft download link tends to fail so it is offered here as a backup location.

SBAppLocale_ENG.zip
SB App Local tool installer.  This is used by the DBCS Fix Plug-In.  This is provided here as a backup location
in case the official download link in the plug-in's configuration form ever goes away.
